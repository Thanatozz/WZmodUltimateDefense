- To double the amount of scavengers, use a text editor to replace "`spawn(`" with "`spawn(2*`"
- To halve the amount of scavengers, use a text editor to replace "`spawn(`" with "`spawn(0.5*`"
- To double the amount of scavenger vipers, use a text editor to replace "`,vipers`" with "`*2,vipers`"
- Read `multiplay/script/mods/configAPI.js` for documentation
